## Part 1: Python Programming

### ðŸš² __[Project 1: Explore US Bike Share Data](https://github.com/am-abdelfatah/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/project_1-us_bikeshare.ipynb)__

__You can view the jupyter notebook for any project by pressing on the blue title of the project it self__

In this project, we made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) 
* We provided a script to import the data and utilize descriptive statistics to answer some interesting questions about. 
* We created an interactive experience in the terminal to handle user inputs to create and present these statistics.

In this lab we will load stock data into a Pandas Dataframe and calculate some statistics on it. We will be working with stock data from Google, Apple, and Amazon. All the stock data was downloaded from yahoo finance in CSV format more can be found by clicking the title of this project.


## Part 2: Data Analysis

What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies that have found a consistent successful formula? Given that major films costing over __$100 million__ to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

We will attempt to answer these question using a data set that contains information about __10,000 movies__ collected from __The Movie Database (TMDb)__, including user ratings and revenue.
