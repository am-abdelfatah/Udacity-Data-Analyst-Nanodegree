In this project, we made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) 
* We provided a script to import the data and utilize descriptive statistics to answer some interesting questions about. 
* We created an interactive experience in the terminal to handle user inputs to create and present these statistics.

In this lab we will load stock data into a Pandas Dataframe and calculate some statistics on it. We will be working with stock data from Google, Apple, and Amazon. All the stock data was downloaded from yahoo finance in CSV format more can be found by clicking the title of this project.


## Part 2: Data Analysis
2 Case Studies and 1 Analysis Project, will be published before 14/12
