    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) \n",
    "* We will write code to import the data and utilize descriptive statistics to answer some interesting questions about. \n",
    "* We will write a script that utilizes a user input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.\n",

    "## The Data\n",
    "* In this project, we will use data provided by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.\n",
    "* We will uncover bike share usage patterns by compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.\n",

    "Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:\n",

    "* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)\n",
    "* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)\n",
    "* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)\n",
    "* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)\n",
    "* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)\n",
